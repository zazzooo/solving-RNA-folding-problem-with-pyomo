# solving-RNA-folding-problem-with-pyomo
In this few line of code I explain solve the RNA folding problem not as usual with dynamic programming but using optimization algorithm. 

This is just for an university project I don't expect that it will worrk for all the sequences. I also have to admit that biology is not my field, I approched to the problem as mathematician. Certainly I did some semplifications thath are not always allowed.

There are three different codes, for the esiest to the harder. There is also a slide presentation to the work (in english) and a colab file (in italian)

For the preject I follow the book “Integer Linear Programming in Computational and Systems Biology: An entry-level text and course” by Dan Gusfield, published by Cambridge University Press.
